Assignment:  Number Class
Grade:  check/check+  (See Course Expectations for interpretation)

1 – What is up with all that stuff in your output that looks like this…The number 129 is _[1mnot even_[m….your output looks pretty ugly and often just uninterpretable.

 2 – You clearly show that you know how good class structure and how to use classes in Objective-C.

3 – Don’t use the conditional operator.  It is note for its ability to obfuscate code.

4 – Good algorithms for each method.  You wrote very clean and efficient code for each method.

In all a good job with few extras and some issues (like the confusing character output).
